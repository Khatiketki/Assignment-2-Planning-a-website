# Assignment-2-Planning-a-website
Purpose: This assignment will allow you to use the techniques explored in class to structure a website with a complex data structure and dynamic (app-like) capabilities. It also challenges you to utilize semantic HTML to appropriately describe the information within a single page. Both are vital skills to learn when creating websites and web-based apps.

Task: The Vallejo Public Library in Vallejo, California has contacted you to help them create their new website.

The website will include the address and opening hours, a form to get a library card, an email address for general inquiries, and a section for the latest news.

It will also contain the complete catalog of books in the library. For each title, the library wants users to get enough information to know if they want to read the book or not. This information must include, apart from book details, the number of copies for each book, and how many of them are available. 

The website should also contain a system for loaning books. The system should be linked to the book catalog. The idea of the loan system is that users who have a library card will be able to request a book online if it's available. The book becomes "reserved" and then the user can physically go to the library and pick up the reserved book.

You are required to do the following:

Create the website map. Include all of the sections needed.
Create a diagram that details the process of reserving a book. It can be a box chart or a flowchart.
Lastly, create the HTML for three pages in the website:
The homepage - this file must be called index.html 
A page representing a book in the catalog
Any other page on the website
These pages must use semantic tags and include:
Header, body, and footer
Navigation to other pages
Information about the book, as it would appear in a library system
How many copies of this book the library has, and how many are there available
A way to start the process of reserving a book copy
